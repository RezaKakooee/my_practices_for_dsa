# My coding practices 

I will soon have to apply for new positions. As most of the positions in machine learning and data science require coding interviews of Data Structures and Algorithms, I want to practice some of these algorithms and relevant programming problems. And here, I would like to share with the public my version of practicing those algorithms and problems.

I copied parts of the codes from different sources. So, please feel free to copy :)
