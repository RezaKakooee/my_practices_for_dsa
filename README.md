# My coding practices 

I will soon have to apply for new positions. As most of the positions in machine learning and data sciences require coding interviews of Data Structures and Algorithms, I would like to practice some of these algorithms and relevant programming problems. Here, I would like to share with the public my version of practicing those algorithms and problems. 

Please feel free to copy.
